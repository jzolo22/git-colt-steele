# Colt Steele Git Course

### **What is Git?**
- a version control system
  - software that tracks and manages changes to files over time
  - allows users to compare changes, revert to previous versions, etc
- most popular VCS

### **What does Git do?**
- track changes
- compare versions
- "time travel" to old versions
- collaborate and share changes
- combine changes
- revert to previous version

### **History of Git**
- Linus Torvalds
  - creater/main developer behind Linux & Git
  - became frustrated with BitKeeper VCS charging money
  - wanted a free VCS that would be open source
  - in April 2005 basic functionality was completed
- Meaning of name (depends on your mood!):
  - random 3-letter combination that is pronounceable and not used by any commmon UNIX command
  - stupid
  - "global information tracker" (for a good mood)
  - "goddamn idiotic truckload of shit" (for a bad mood)

### **Git vs GitHub**
- **Git** is the VCS that runs locally on your machine
  - do not need an account, don't need the internet, etc 
  - (kind of like using Microsoft Word on a computer)
  - primarily a terminal based tool
- **Github** is the online service that hosts Git repos in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people
- As a developer, you could use Git only and never touch Github.

### **Git Repository**
- workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder
- anytime we want Git to track our project, we need to create a new git repository
  - MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT ALREADY INSIDE A REPO - don't want to have nested repos
- Git tracks from top down - i.e. the top level folder should be where git is initialized
