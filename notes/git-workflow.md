# Git Workflow

### **Workflow**
1. Work on stuff (Working Directory)
   - make new files, edit files, delete files, etc
2. Add changes (Staging Area)
   - group specific changes together in preparation to commit
3. Commit (Repository)
   - everything that was added in step 2

### **What is Committing**
- adding a "snapshot" or "checkpoint"
- *Atomic Comits* - when possible, a commit should encompass a *single* change, feature or fix
- for commit messages:
  - git recommends imperative voice (i.e. "make x do y" instead of "made x do y")
  -
